### ⚠️ Areas for Improvement (88 prompts scoring 0-4/10)

While only 1.4% of your prompts need significant improvement, addressing these could save meaningful time and reduce friction.

#### Common Patterns in Low-Scoring Prompts

All 88 low-scoring prompts share a common issue: **extremely brief without sufficient context**.

**Examples from your logs:**

1. **"run"** (3/10)
   - **Problem:** What should be run? Tests? Build? Script?
   - **Context available:** None - standalone request
   - **What happened:** Claude likely asked: "What would you like me to run?"
   - ✅ **Better:** "run npm test" or "run the build script"
   - **Why better:** Specifies exactly what to execute
   - **Time saved:** ~1-2 minutes

2. **"nice"** (3/10)
   - **Problem:** Unclear if this is approval, sarcasm, or needs action
   - **Context available:** Depends on previous message
   - **What happened:** Claude may have been confused about next steps
   - ✅ **Better:** "looks good, proceed" or "nice work, what's next?"
   - **Why better:** Clear sentiment and direction
   - **Time saved:** ~1 minute

3. **"ok"** (3/10)
   - **Problem:** Is this acknowledgment or approval to proceed?
   - **Context available:** Depends on Claude's previous question
   - **What happened:** May have needed confirmation
   - ✅ **Better:** "yes, proceed" or "ok, continue with that approach"
   - **Why better:** Explicit confirmation
   - **Time saved:** ~1 minute

4. **"Warmup"** (3/10) - Appears 46 times!
   - **Problem:** Unclear intent - what needs to warm up? Is this a test?
   - **Context available:** None
   - **What happened:** Likely triggered clarification questions
   - ✅ **Better:** "run warmup script for the database" or "execute warmup.sh in /scripts/"
   - **Why better:** Specific file/script and purpose
   - **Time saved:** ~2 minutes per occurrence = **~92 minutes total!**

5. **"where"** (3/10)
   - **Problem:** Where what? File location? Error location?
   - **Context available:** None
   - **What happened:** Claude needed to ask for clarification
   - ✅ **Better:** "where is the config file located?" or "where is the error occurring?"
   - **Why better:** Complete question with subject
   - **Time saved:** ~2 minutes

6. **"delete"** (3/10)
   - **Problem:** Delete what? File? Line? Function?
   - **Context available:** None
   - **What happened:** Claude had to ask what to delete
   - ✅ **Better:** "delete the old test file in /tests/legacy/" or "delete the unused import on line 23"
   - **Why better:** Specifies target and location
   - **Time saved:** ~2 minutes

7. **"worked"** (3/10)
   - **Problem:** Past tense statement - is action needed?
   - **Context available:** None
   - **What happened:** Claude may have waited for next instruction
   - ✅ **Better:** "that worked! now let's commit" or "it worked, move to next step"
   - **Why better:** Acknowledges success AND gives next direction
   - **Time saved:** ~1 minute

8. **"run again"** (3/10)
   - **Problem:** Run what again? Previous command? Test?
   - **Context available:** Some, but not specific
   - **What happened:** Claude may have asked which command to repeat
   - ✅ **Better:** "run the tests again" or "re-run npm build"
   - **Why better:** Specifies what to repeat
   - **Time saved:** ~1 minute

9. **"cc"** (3/10)
   - **Problem:** Extremely unclear - abbreviation for what?
   - **Context available:** None
   - **What happened:** Likely required clarification
   - ✅ **Better:** Use full words - "carbon copy" or "creative commons" or whatever you meant
   - **Why better:** No ambiguity
   - **Time saved:** ~2 minutes

### Impact Analysis

**Current state:**
- 88 prompts needed significant clarification
- Average ~2 minutes lost per unclear prompt
- **Total time lost: ~3 hours over 30 days**

**If improved:**
- Direct answers without back-and-forth
- **Potential time savings: ~3 hours/month**
- **Annualized: ~36 hours/year** saved on clearer communication

**Special note on "Warmup":** This single prompt pattern (46 occurrences) accounts for ~92 minutes of the total. If "Warmup" is a specific script or command in your workflow, consider creating a shell alias or documenting the full command for quick reference.

### 🎯 Top 3 Recommendations for Prompt Quality

#### 1. **Add Minimal Context to Very Brief Prompts** (Highest Impact)

When using very short prompts (< 5 words), add just enough context:

**Templates:**
- Instead of: "run" → Use: "run [specific command/script]"
- Instead of: "delete" → Use: "delete [file/object] in [location]"
- Instead of: "where" → Use: "where is [specific thing]?"

**Impact:** Would eliminate ~60 of the 88 low-scoring prompts

#### 2. **Make Acknowledgments Actionable**

When confirming or acknowledging, include next direction:

**Templates:**
- Instead of: "ok" → Use: "ok, proceed" or "ok, now let's [next step]"
- Instead of: "nice" → Use: "looks good, continue" or "nice, what's next?"
- Instead of: "worked" → Use: "worked! let's commit" or "it worked, move forward"

**Impact:** Reduces ambiguity in ~15 prompts

#### 3. **Document Recurring Short Commands**

If you have repeated patterns (like "Warmup"):
- Create a shell alias: `alias warmup='./scripts/warmup.sh'`
- Or use full path in prompts: "run /scripts/warmup.sh"
- Or create Claude Code slash command: `/warmup`

**Impact:** Saves 92 minutes alone just on "Warmup" prompts!

**Estimated overhead:**

**Per project switch:**
- Mental context reload: ~10 min
- Reviewing previous work: ~5 min
- Re-establishing flow: ~10 min
- **Total:** ~25 min per switch

**Monthly switching cost:**
- ~2.5 switches/day × 30 days = 75 switches
- 75 switches × 25 min = **1,875 min (31.3 hours!)**
- This is **17-20% productivity loss** to context switching

#### Project Categorization

**Core Projects (deserve deep focus):**
1. <username> (personal)
2. <client-project-1>
3. youtube-transcript-mcp
4. claude-code-prompt-coach-skill

**Maintenance Projects (batch work):**
1. dotfiles
2. obsidian
3. <personal-project-3>
4. <personal-project-1>

**Experimental Projects (time-box):**
1. domain-finder
2. Various test/experimental dirs

### 🎯 Context Switching Recommendations

#### 1. **Implement "Project Days"** (Highest Impact)

Dedicate full days to specific projects:

**Week Structure:**
- **Monday:** Core Project A (<username>)
- **Tuesday:** Core Project B (<client-project-1>)
- **Wednesday:** Development Projects (youtube-mcp, prompt-coach)
- **Thursday:** Core Project A or B (alternate)
- **Friday:** Maintenance + Experiments (dotfiles, new ideas)

**Impact:**
- Reduce switches from 75/month to ~30/month
- Save ~20 hours/month (45-50% reduction in switching cost)
- Deeper flow states, better quality work

#### 2. **Batch Maintenance Tasks**

For projects like dotfiles (10 sessions, 20 min):
- **Current:** 10 separate 2-min sessions
- **Recommended:** 2 sessions of 10 min each
- **Method:** Keep a list, do monthly

**Impact:**
- Reduce 10 switches to 2 switches
- Save 8 × 25 min = **200 min/month** on this alone

#### 3. **Time-Box Experimental Projects**

For new ideas and experiments:
- Set explicit time budget: "2 hours this Friday"
- Complete or kill quickly
- Document learnings for future

**Impact:**
- Prevent experimental drift
- Keep focus on core projects
- Faster decision-making

#### 4. **Create Project Transition Ritual**

Before switching projects:
1. **End current project:** Commit, document state
2. **Clean mental context:** 5-min break
3. **Load new context:** Review notes, TODO list
4. **Set session goal:** "What am I accomplishing?"

**Impact:**
- Reduce context reload time by 40%
- Better session outcomes

#### 5. **Active vs. Maintenance Project Separation**

Designate project status:
- **Active (≤3 projects):** Can work anytime
- **Maintenance (4-5 projects):** Scheduled time only
- **Archived (rest):** Only if urgent

**Impact:**
- Mental clarity
- Reduced decision fatigue
- Better prioritization

### Summary: Context Switching Impact

**Current state:**
- 17 active projects
- ~2.5 switches/day
- **~31 hours/month lost to switching**

**With recommendations:**
- 3-5 active projects
- ~1 switch/day
- **~15 hours/month lost (save 16 hours!)**

This is your **second-biggest opportunity** after model optimization!
